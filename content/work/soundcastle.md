Soundcastle is an augmented reality sandbox that is used to synthesize and play back sounds/music in real time.  This is a novel extension of an augmented reality project created by researchers in <a href="http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/index.html">Oliver Kreylos</a>' group at UC Davis.

Soundcastle consists of a sandbox, an Xbox Kinect, and a projector. The Kinect measures the 3D surface profile of the sand, and the projector overlays a color-coded contour plot of the sand's topography in real time.  This profile is then interpreted as an audio spectrogram, and used to generate an audio sample.  This audio sample is played back in real time for the sculptor to hear.

A spectrogram is a 3D plot used to visualize the frequency and amplitude content of audio.

In Soundcastle, the projector displays a scroll line on the sand/contour plot to indicate the time position of the sound being synthesized.  This line moves across the sand at a constant rate and returns to the start after reaching the end.  In other words, Soundcastle is being used to create an audio loop.
