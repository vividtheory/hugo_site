Underground parties, DJ nights, Nature Nocturne... the vivid light tubes are becoming a familiar sight around some circles of the Ottawa nightlife scene.  The combination of programmable LEDs, a dazzling cover material, and unique programming produce some captivating effects.  Just check out some of these [videos](https://vimeo.com/user51003445/videos).

Physically, the vivid light tubes are not complicated.  Strips of programmable LED are enclosed in cylinders of Rowlux illusion film.  This film has a pattern refractive index which creates a unique light diffusion effect.

The individually addressable LEDs are driven by Fadecandy boards, which can be connected to different controllers (usually a laptop or raspberry pi... depends on the application).  

As is standard practice for Vivid Theory, the light tubes are almost always controlled by custom software.  While there exist many excellent applications for controlling LED installations,  doing things from scratch has a unique appeal for theorists and coders. For live VJing (e.g. at DJ nights), the current incarnation of software is being developed in C++ using OpenFrameworks. This provides almost limitless possibilites for interaction and engagement with the art (sound reactivity, Xbox kinect, leapmotion...).
